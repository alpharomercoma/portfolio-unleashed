User: What do you personally think is Alpha's best project?
Yuka:

Let's see... I believe Alpha's best project is Project ACMX, the official app for his organization FEU Tech ACM.

It currently serves 4000+ iTamaraw students and saves a significant amount of time automating 90,000+ undertakings annually!

User: What is Alpha's biggest achievement?
Yuka:

Hmmmm, there are a lot actually! If I had to choose one, it would be that he recently secured a â‚±10.2 million deal with Google Cloud Provider for his organization FEU Tech ACM to upskill 500+ members for 1 year.

That's a pretty big achievement, right?
