[NIHONGO Stories]
Let's read Alpha-san's story!

Have you ever heard of VTubers? It was around two years ago when I stumbled upon a particular VTuber who was live-streaming a game. Even though I couldn't understand her words since there were no subtitles, I couldn't tear my eyes away because it was just so entertaining!

From that moment on, something ignited within me, and I developed a genuine interest in the Japanese language. Every day, I started dedicating a little time to self-study, and my world began to expand. Now, I can enjoy VTuber streams, anime, and Japanese TV shows, read manga, keep up with Japanese news and blogs, and even listen to Vocaloid music—all with understanding! I've even begun writing about my incredible experiences in Japanese on my blog, and guess what? I have become the bridge that connects our family to our extended Japanese family!

But here's the astonishing part: my interest in Japanese didn't merely remain a hobby. It has opened up astonishing opportunities for me in my professional life as well! Different companies have approached me for translator and management positions. Can you imagine that? I owe this incredible transformation in my life to that rabbit VTuber. I want to express a heartfelt thank you peko ❤ to everyone at Hololive!

Learning Japanese poses a unique challenge that goes beyond the intricacies of the language itself; it's also about finding opportunities for meaningful communication with others who can speak Japanese. Speaking from my own experience, I've had limited chances to converse in the language, aside from interacting with my extended family in Japan. While there are many anime and Japanese culture enthusiasts in the Philippines, it's quite rare to encounter individuals who can engage in even a conversational level of Japanese.

Although I haven't yet overcome this challenge, I'm actively taking steps to tackle it. I'm exploring Manila, the bustling capital of the Philippines, participating in events, and seeking out people who share similar interests. Hopefully, our paths will cross soon, and we can become friends who can connect through our shared passion for Japanese language and culture.

Learning Japanese has numerous benefits, not only for one's lifestyle but also for career and professional growth. Mastering this notoriously challenging language not only grants you a sense of accomplishment but also elevates your status among your peers, university community, and workplace. In the period leading up to the JLPT exams, I had the opportunity to chat with fellow test takers and learn about their motivations for studying Japanese. Their reasons varied, ranging from personal enjoyment and familial connections to career advancement. It was inspiring to witness their pride, intelligence, and optimism. In fact, several companies, including IBM, even provided employment information for translators and management positions! So, embrace the adventure and be resilient in your pursuit of learning Japanese. The rewards are well worth the effort!

“Nihongo Stories” is a weekly series where we ask Filipinos who are learning Nihongo about their experiences learning Japanese, their tricks to learning, their struggles, or their realizations that they would like to share with fellow Nihongo learners. We hope that by sharing their experiences, we can inspire each other to continue our Nihongo learning journey!
